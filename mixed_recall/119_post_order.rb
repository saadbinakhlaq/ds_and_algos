Write a function, is_binary_search_tree, that takes in the root of a binary tree. The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not the tree satisfies the binary search tree property.

A Binary Search Tree is a binary tree where all values within a node's left subtree are smaller than the node's value and all values in a node's right subtree are greater than or equal to the node's value.
