=begin
Write a function, rare_routing, that takes in a number of cities (n) and a list of tuples where each tuple represents a direct road that connects a pair of cities. The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not there exists a unique route for every pair of cities. A route is a sequence of roads that does not visit a city more than once.

Cities will be numbered 0 to n - 1.

You can assume that all roads are two-way roads. This means if there is a road between A and B, then you can use that road to go from A to B or go from B to A.
