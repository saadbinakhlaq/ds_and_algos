=begin
Write a function, build_tree_in_pre, that takes in a list of in-ordered values and a list of pre-ordered values for a binary tree. The function should build a binary tree that has the given in-order and pre-order traversal structure. The function should return the root of this tree.

You can assume that the values of inorder and preorder are unique.
