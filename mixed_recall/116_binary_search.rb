=begin
Write a function, binary_search, that takes in a sorted list of numbers and a target. The function should return the index where the target can be found within the list. If the target is not found in the list, then return -1.

You may assume that the input array contains unique numbers sorted in increasing order.

Your function must implement the binary search algorithm.
