=begin
Write a function, token_replace, that takes in a dictionary of tokens and a string. The function should return a new string where tokens are replaced.

Tokens are enclosed in a pair of '$'. You can assume that the input string is properly formatted. Tokens should be replaced from left to right in the string (see test_05).
