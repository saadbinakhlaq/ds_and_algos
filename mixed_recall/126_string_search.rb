=begin
Write a function, string_search, that takes in a grid of letters and a string as arguments. The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not the string can be found in the grid as a path by connecting horizontal or vertical positions. The path can begin at any position, but you cannot reuse a position more than once in the path.

You can assume that all letters are lowercase and alphabetic.
