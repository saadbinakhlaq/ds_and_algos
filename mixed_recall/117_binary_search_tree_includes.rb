Write a function, binary_search_tree_includes, that takes in the root of a binary search tree containing numbers and a target value. The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not the target is found within the tree.

A Binary Search Tree is a binary tree where all values within a node's left subtree are smaller than the node's value and all values in a node's right subtree are greater than or equal to the node's value.

Your solution should have a best case runtime of O(log(n)).
